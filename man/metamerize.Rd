\title{Create metamers}
\usage{
metamerize(data, preserve, minimize = NULL, change = colnames(data),
  signif = 2, N = 100, trim = N, annealing = TRUE,
  perturbation = 0.08, name = NULL, verbose = interactive())
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{data.frame} with the starting data or a \code{metamer_list} object returned
by a previous call to the function.}

\item{preserve}{A function whose result must be kept exactly the same.
Must take the data as argument and return a numeric vector.}

\item{minimize}{An optional function to minimize in the process. Must take
the data as argument and return a single numeric.}

\item{change}{A character vector with the names of the columns that need to be
changed.}

\item{signif}{The number of significant digits of \code{preserve} that need to be
preserved.}

\item{N}{Number of iterations.}

\item{trim}{Max number of metamers to return.}

\item{annealing}{Logical indicating whether to perform annealing.}

\item{perturbation}{Numeric with the magnitude of the random perturbations.
Can be of length 1 or \code{length(change)}.}

\item{name}{Character for naming the metamers.}

\item{verbose}{Logical indicating whether to show a progress bar.}
}
\value{
A \code{metamer_list} object (a list of data.frames).
}
\description{
Produces very dissimilar datasets with the same statistical properties.
}
\details{
It follows Matejka & Fitzmaurice (2017) method of constructing metamers.
Beginning from a starting dataset, it iteratively adds a small perturbation,
checks if \code{preserve} returns the same value (up to \code{signif} significant digits)
and if \code{minimize} has been lowered, and accepts the solution for the next
round. If \code{annealing} is \code{TRUE}, it also accepts solutions with bigger
\code{minimize} with an ever decreasing probability to help the algorithm avoid
local minimums.

If \code{data} is a \code{metamer_list}, the function will start the algorithm from the
last metamer of the list. Furthermore, if \code{preserve} and/or \code{minimize}
are missing, the previous functions will be carried over from the previous call.

\code{minimize} can be also a \emph{vector} of functions. In that case, the process minimizes
the product of the functions applied to the data.

data(cars)
# Metamers of `cars` with the same mean speed and dist, and correlation
# between the two.
means_and_cor <- delayed_with(mean_speed = mean(speed),
                              mean_dist = mean(dist),
                              cor = cor(speed, dist))
set.seed(42)  # for reproducibility.
metamers <- metamerize(cars,
                       preserve = means_and_cor,
                       signif = 3,
                       N = 1000)
print(metamers)

last <- metamers[[length(metamers)]]

# Confirm that the statistics are the same
cbind(original = means_and_cor(cars),
      metamer = means_and_cor(last))

# Visualize
plot(metamers[[length(metamers)]])
points(cars, col = "red")
